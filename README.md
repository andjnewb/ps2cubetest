# ps2cubetest
This is meant to be used in a ps2dev docker container. I use "docker run -it --mount src="$(pwd)",target=/usr/local/test,type=bind ps2dev/ps2dev:latest" in Powershell to bind the current directory, which is my source directory, to a directory in the docker container. Note that once launched, the container will need some configuration before it will successfully compile. You will need to run "apk add gcc clang make cmake patch git texinfo flex bison gettext wget gsl gmp zlib mpfr mpc" from within the docker container. Environment variable export may be necessary, refer to the ps2dev github repository.
